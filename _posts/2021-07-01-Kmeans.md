# Kmeans Clustering
<img src="\assets\images\Kmeans\Diagram.jpg" alt="Alt text">
#### Steps
1. Choose number of Clusters = k
2. A randomly chosen k number of points are chosen as the center of clusters
3. Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster
4. The centroid of each of the k clusters becomes the new mean
5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until convergence has been reached

#### Strengths
 - Simple Argorithm, Fast
 - Larger dataset can be dealt with than hierarchical clustering
 - Insight can be drawn without prior knowledge of the dataset
 - Can be used for a various types of datasets

#### Weaknesses
 - Difficulty in defining the distance and number of clusters
 - Since there is usually no given objective for the model, interpretation may be difficult
 - Heavily effected by outliers

Code Example : 
library(cluster)         #Perform clustering
library(compareGroups)   #Descriptive Statistics
library(HDclassif)       #Data library
library(NbClust)         
library(sparcl)          

    Import Data : 
        data(wine)
        str(wine)
        names(wine) <- c("Class", "Alcohol", "MalicAcid", "Ash", "Alk_ash",
                        "magnesium", "T_phenols", "Flavanoids", "Non_flav",
                        "Proantho", "C_Intensity", "Hue", "OD280_315", "Proline")
        names(wine)
        df <- as.data.frame(scale(wine[, -1])) #평균0, 표준편차 1
        summary(df)
        table(wine$Class)

    Find Optimal number of clusters : 
        numKMeans <- NbClust(df,             
                            min.nc = 2, 
                            max.nc = 15, 
                            method = "kmeans")

    Create model based on optimal clusters :     
        set.seed(1234)
        km <- kmeans(df, 
                    3,      
                    nstart = 25)

    Information on model : 
        table(km$cluster)

        km$centers   # Cluster mean for each variable
        km$cluster   # Assigned cluster for each data point

        wine$km_cluster <- km$cluster
        table(km$cluster, wine$Class)

    Visualize model : 
        par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
        boxplot(wine$Alcohol ~ km$cluster, 
                main = "Alcohol Content, K-Means")
        boxplot(wine$Alcohol ~ ward3, 
                main = "Alcohol Content, Ward's")
